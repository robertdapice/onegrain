The Open Budget
===============

Welcome to [TheOpenBudget.org](http://theopenbudget.org) Github repository.

It's a little bare here at the moment; we hacked TheOpenBudget together in a weekend for [GovHack 2012](http://www.govhack.org/). The code is a bit of a mess, so play around with it at your own peril.

Note that the Ruby on Rails database code can be used to generate data.json dynamically, 'on the fly'. However, when deployed, we create a static version of data.json for much faster loading speeds.
